# Flipkart Web Scraper

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **web scraper for Flipkart**, built using **Selenium and BeautifulSoup**, to extract product details such as **name, price, specifications, ratings, and reviews**. It automates browsing, scrolls dynamically to load content, and navigates to individual product pages to fetch detailed information. The collected data can be **saved in a structured format** for further analysis.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Selenium** (for browser automation)
- **BeautifulSoup** (for HTML parsing)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **tqdm** (for progress tracking)
- **Requests** (for handling HTTP requests)

## 📂 Features
✅ Extracts **product names, prices, discounts, and ratings**
✅ Extracts **detailed specifications** (RAM, storage, model, etc.)
✅ Extracts **customer reviews and rating distribution**
✅ **Automates scrolling** to load dynamic content
✅ Stores data in a structured format (CSV, DataFrame, etc.)
✅ Handles missing data gracefully

## 🚀 Installation
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 pandas tqdm requests
```
You also need **ChromeDriver** compatible with your Chrome browser version. Download it from [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/).

## 📝 Code Explanation
### 1️⃣ Importing Libraries
